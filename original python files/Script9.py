# UK Hydrocarbon Duty (Fuel Tax) is 57.95 pence per litre of petrol.
# VAT (sales tax) is also charged on both the fuel and the duty.

# A garage sells petrol at 37.88p a litre before tax.
# A customer purchases 60 litres of petrol.  Calculate the total cost and
#   how much of that is tax (all to nearest pence).

pricePerL = 0.3788     # In pounds before tax
quantityL = 60        # Number of litres bought

print("Tax: £" + str(round(quantityL*0.5795 + (pricePerL*quantityL)/(100*20),
